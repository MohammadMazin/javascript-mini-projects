## Learn how to fetch data using async,await and with loading states

This is a simple project for learning the basics of how async-await works in Javascript.
It fetches quotes from "https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quote" and displays it on the screen.
An additional feature was to show a Loading "state" for better user experience and how error messages can be shown to notify the user

## Steps to Run

- Open the HTML file in the web browser
- THATS IT! You can now click the button to fetch quotes

The app.js file has comments to explain the different parts of the code.

## If you feel like challenging yourself

- Disable the button while the data is being fetched so it can't be clicked multiple times
- Append all the quotes in a single div so it appears as a list of quotes
- Try out different APIs (ie. weather, IMDB)
